      <description>Hey everyone! I’m excited to announce my new online course for learning direct Stan coding for Bayesian analysis. Available starting this Friday; enroll here: https://athlyticz.com/stan-i.
— TL;DR —
Actual Stan coding, not a high-level interface At-your-own-pace videos: shows live coding while explaining Hosted RStudio session to practice alongside me Starts with fundamentals, builds to hierarchical models Emphasizes a Bayesian workflow Modeling applied to sports data My goal is to make learning Stan as easy as possible.</description>

      <title>Speedy splines part two, derivative work</title>

      <description>In the last post, I showed how we can speed up computation for splines in Stan. This post is, ahem, derivative. Perhaps we have noisy data of position and time, and we want to estimate speed and acceleration. We can use b-splines and their derivatives for this.
So let’s pick up where we left off, and add calculations in Stan to calculate the first and second derivatives of the spline in Stan.</description>

      <description>Milad Kharratzadeh provides a helpful case study on estimating splines in Stan. We can improve on his work with a few tricks to speed up the estimation process. Namely, if we decompose the spline matrix using QR decomposition, we speed up Stan’s fitting process by at least an order of magnitude.
Here’s how we can alter the code to accommodate splines with a few tricks to speed things up:</description>

      <title>Dynamic, physics-informed systems in Bayesian models</title>

      <description>By dynamic systems, I mean using differential equations to describe how data changes over time. Take running speed, for example. Several physics-based models of running speed have been developed, which I’ve previously discussed. The primary goal in those previous discussions involving sprint speed have been in estimating a maximum speed. But the underlying structure of these models estimate change in speed at time two from speed at time one: a differential equation.</description>

      <title>Stan Is Not an Acronym: Bayesian Solutions to Sabermetric Shortcomings</title>

      <description>Here is our description of our presentation at Saberseminar 2018: “A common definition of sabermetrics is the application of statistics to baseball. However, despite clear progress over the past few decades, we argue that sabermetrics has largely ignored the most important statistical principle to baseball: generative modeling. In this talk we discuss several conceptual errors with sabermetrics that preclude optimal decision making. Each of these problems can be overcome using a principled Bayesian approach to inference, which we demonstrate using the Stan statistical software.</description>
