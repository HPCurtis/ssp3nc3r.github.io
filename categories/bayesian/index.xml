      <description>In this post, I want to address why Bayesian modeling approaches, especially those implemented in Stan, should be considered as a valid alternative to common machine learning techniques in sports analytics. Specifically, I’ll focus on a well-established criterion for model evaluation: leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) and its use to calculate the expected log predictive density (ELPD). This scoring rule measures how well a model predicts unseen data. If you’d like a deeper explanation of ELPD and its interpretation in the context of this example, I’ll include one in an appendix at the end.</description>

      <title>Bayesian modeling recurring sports injuries</title>

      <description>Each sport carries with it specific types of injury risks. Pitching in baseball: UCL, rotator cuffs, and elbow injuries. Soccer: ACL tears, hamstrings, ankles. And so forth. Understanding the risks of injury is the first step in minimizing or preventing such injuries. In this post, I outline a Bayesian model for modeling these risks.
Let’s say we want to model \(K\) types of injury in a given sport, with the possibility of a player having multiple injuries over time.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! I’m excited to announce my new online course for learning direct Stan coding for Bayesian analysis. Available now; enroll here: https://athlyticz.com/stan-i.
— TL;DR —
Actual Stan coding, not a high-level interface At-your-own-pace videos: shows live coding while explaining Hosted RStudio session to practice alongside me Starts with fundamentals, builds to hierarchical models Emphasizes a Bayesian workflow Modeling applied to sports data My goal is to make learning Stan as easy and fast as possible.</description>

      <title>Pitch selection to maximize motion-in-depth variation</title>

      <description>Those in baseball are well aware of the concept of platoon advantage: batters tend to have an advantage when facing pitchers of the opposite handedness. But knowledge of a platoon advantage may go beyond choice of relief pitchers on the mound to matchup with the upcoming lineup of power batters. It may inform, among other things, pitching strategy.
Considering reasons behind the phenomenon, it may be explained by the greater relative variation in movement of the ball inside a batter’s plane of sight, which I’ll define in a moment, while same-handed pitchers tend to keep the ball’s trajectory more aligned with that plane, making it harder to perceive lateral movement.</description>

      <title>The case for physics, geometry, and variation in sports models</title>

      <description>Traditional machine learning of sports performance often overlooks the physical constraints of the game, making models prone to identifying patterns driven by selection bias rather than actual game dynamics. Machine learning models may overfit to confounding variables, generating predictions that are not generalizable or realistic without grounding predictions in the known physics and geometry of sports, including baseball.
Physics, geometry, and trigonometry govern all movement in sports performance, like baseball&amp;mdash;from the ball&amp;rsquo;s trajectories off the mound or in the outfield to player positioning, rounding bases, throws, and ball contact with bats, dirt, and grass.</description>
