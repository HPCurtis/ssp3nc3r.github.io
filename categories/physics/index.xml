      <description>Traditional machine learning of sports performance often overlooks the physical constraints of the game, making models prone to identifying patterns driven by selection bias rather than actual game dynamics. Machine learning models may overfit to confounding variables, generating predictions that are not generalizable or realistic without grounding predictions in the known physics and geometry of sports, including baseball.
Physics, geometry, and trigonometryÂ govern all movement in sports performance, like baseball&amp;mdash;from the ball&amp;rsquo;s trajectories off the mound or in the outfield to player positioning, rounding bases, throws, and ball contact with bats, dirt, and grass.</description>
