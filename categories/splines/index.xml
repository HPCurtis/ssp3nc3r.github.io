      <description>In the last post, I showed how we can speed up computation for splines in Stan. This post is, ahem, derivative. Perhaps we have noisy data of position and time, and we want to estimate speed and acceleration. We can use b-splines and their derivatives for this.
So let’s pick up where we left off, and add calculations in Stan to calculate the first and second derivatives of the spline in Stan.</description>

      <description>Milad Kharratzadeh provides a helpful case study on estimating splines in Stan. We can improve on his work with a few tricks to speed up the estimation process. Namely, if we decompose the spline matrix using QR decomposition, we speed up Stan’s fitting process by at least an order of magnitude.
Here’s how we can alter the code to accommodate splines with a few tricks to speed things up:</description>
