McElreath's *Statistical Rethinking* is among the best books for learning Bayesian statistics (he has a second edition coming out too). As an exercise in pedagogy, I've recoded all his examples directly into Stan, a probabilistic programming language. Recoding examples from one programming language into another is a great way to practice learning that other language. Give it a try. I've made my recoded examples available [here](https://github.com/ssp3nc3r/rethinking) if you get stuck or want to compare methods of coding.
