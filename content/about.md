ssp3nc3r lectures in the applied analytics graduate program at Columbia University, his alma mater. He works with core developers of `Stan`, a probabilistic programming language, building Bayesian, generative models of complex processes involving both human behavior and physical phenomena.

He focuses modeling work on data for good, and on professional sports. Recent efforts are on the spatial and temporal impact of sea-level rise on the perceived value of coastal properties, and on major league baseball player and team performance. His work in modeling and communication arise from a doctor of jurisprudence, master of science in sports management focused on data science analytics, and bachelor of science in chemical engineering focused on numerical methods and statistical process control.

His analyses have extended to other domains as well. Previously, he analyzed data and communicated statistical insights, persuading various stakeholders of his technology clients (including Vevo, Freewheel, Johnson & Johnson, Dow Agrosciences, Qualcomm, Fitbod, and Amazon) on the impact of his analyses for decisions related to patent litigation and licensing.

The most persuasive communications are transparent and account for uncertainty, which are two areas of interest in his research and work in quantitative communication through visualization and storytelling. Along with research he has collaborated and published variously. These include analyses, editing, and research for _The Real Madrid Way_ (BenBella Books 2016), of which Billy Bean (Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations at the Oakland A’s) has said “will be one of the most influential books on sports ever written.” He has a forthcoming monograph and literature review on quantitative communication amid uncertainty.

Along with honors recognition for research and writing, his visualizations have been showcased and longlisted in the Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards, and his analyses have won analytics competitions, including the Society for American Baseball Research’s analytics competition, graduate division for his work involving human decision-making based on perception of spatial and temporal event information. He is fluent in `R`, codes in `Stan` for Bayesian modeling, `ggplot2` and `D3.js` for visualization. Other tools include `Git`, `Rmd`, `SQL`, `C++`, `macOS`, and `Adobe CC`.
