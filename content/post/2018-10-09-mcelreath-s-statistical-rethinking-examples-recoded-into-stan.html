<hr />
<p>McElreath’s <em>Statistical Rethinking</em> is among the best books for learning Bayesian statistics (he has a second edition coming out too). As an exercise in pedagogy, I’ve recoded all his examples directly into Stan, a probabilistic programming language. Recoding examples from one programming language into another is a great way to practice learning that other language. Give it a try. I’ve made my recoded examples available <a href="https://github.com/ssp3nc3r/rethinking">here</a> if you get stuck or want to compare methods of coding.</p>
