<h1>Modeling batters’ choices to swing and abilities to contact the ball</h1>
<p>Models for decisions to swing and ball contact are more nuanced than a model for called pitches (see <em>Modeling Umpire Calls</em>). Batters’ abilities to contact the ball at a given pitch location are presumably not independent of their decisions to swing. Common approaches for jointly modeling selections (choices to swing) that influence outcomes (ball contact) are called <em>sample selection</em> models <span class="citation">(Hasselt <a href="#ref-vanHasselt:2011jd">2011</a>)</span>, and can generally be written as,</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:heckman">\[\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
S^* &amp;= X_1 \beta_1 + U_1,\\
S &amp;= I(S^*&gt;0),\\
  Y &amp;= \left\{
  \begin{array}{@{}ll@{}}
    X_2 \beta_2 + U_2, &amp; \text{if}\ S=1 \\
    \textrm{missing}, &amp; \textrm{otherwise}
  \end{array}\right.
\end{split}
\tag{1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is a binary selection variable (a swing) that indicates whether the unobserved <span class="math inline">\(S^*\)</span> is above a threshold. <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> are independent variables where <span class="math inline">\(X_2 \subset X_1\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> are coefficients, and <span class="math inline">\(U_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U_2\)</span> are unobserved variance. <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is our outcome (ball contact). Using a Bayesian approach <span class="citation">(Jeliazkov and Yang <a href="#ref-Jeliazkov:2014tg">2014</a>, Chapter 4)</span>, we can jointly model selection and outcome as bivariate normal with variance reparameterized as,</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:covar1">\[\begin{equation}
\textrm{Var}(U \mid X) = \Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; \sigma_{12} \\ \sigma_{12} &amp; \sigma_{12}^2 + \xi^2 \end{bmatrix} 
\tag{2}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{12}\)</span> is the covariance between <span class="math inline">\(U_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U_2\)</span> while <span class="math inline">\(\xi^2\)</span> is the conditional variance of <span class="math inline">\(U_2\)</span>, given <span class="math inline">\(U_1\)</span>. We separate the task into steps. First, we identify variables that inform the batters’ choices to swing (the selection submodel). We repeat this step, identifying variables that inform the batters’ ability to contact the ball (the outcome submodel). Then we setup a joint model.</p>

<h2>Variables informing the probability of swinging (the selection submodel)</h2>
<p>Different from umpires’ calls, batters’ choices to swing depend on <em>anticipated</em> ball location in relation to his strike zone. To make contact, batters must decide whether to swing approximately 175 milliseconds before the ball crosses the plate <span class="citation">(Higuchi et al. <a href="#ref-Higuchi:2016iu">2016</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">(Adair <a href="#ref-Adair:2017vc">2017</a>)</span>, and <span class="citation">(Cross <a href="#ref-Cross:2011vi">2011</a>)</span>. Notably, though, some physical properties of ball flight are approximately constant throughout: ball (de)accelerations in the x, y, and z directions. This means that batters may assess ball accelerations in the first portion of the ball flight, and rely on their assessments to estimate ball location and timing for ball contact.</p>
<p>Human perception of acceleration is imperfect, and studies suggest that batters more accurately detect horizontal movement than vertical movement <span class="citation">(Bahill and Baldwin <a href="#ref-Bahill:2010ur">2015</a>)</span>. Recall that we’ve already seen evidence of depth perception issues when considering umpire calls. Similarly, we anticipate that changes in ball velocity in the vertical direction, relative to vertical location, better inform whether batters (mistakenly) choose to swing at balls, even those outside the strike zone.</p>
<p>Decisions to swing also depend on other factors. Beyond ball flight physics, game context should matter, too. Especially ball-strike count. Whether the pitcher has been throwing strikes should also be important. We can model trends of our estimates for called strike probabilities as</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:moveavg">\[\begin{equation}
a_t = \alpha x_t + (1 - \alpha) a_{t-1}
\tag{3}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> represents intervals in time (each pitch) and <span class="math inline">\(a_t\)</span> is an exponentially weighted moving average <span class="citation">(Cowpertwait and Metcalfe <a href="#ref-Cowpertwait:2009vm">2009</a>)</span> of the called strike probability. The parameter <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in [0,1]\)</span> determines how much weight batters place on previous pitches. A value of one indicates only the last pitch matters (no smoothing), while a value of zero means all earlier pitches matter (complete smoothing). We omit this time dependency, though, in a first model, to get started. This portion of the model specification includes,</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:swing1">\[\begin{equation}
p(\textrm{decision = swing}) \sim \textrm{ball-strike count} + \\
                                  \mathcal{S}(\textrm{x}, \textrm{z}_{\textrm{centered}}, \textrm{zone height}, \textrm{by = stands, throws}, k = 50) + \\
                                  \textrm{t2}(\textrm{z}_{\textrm{centered}}, \textrm{z}_{\textrm{acceleration}}) + \\
                                  (1 \mid \textrm{batter}) + (1 \mid \textrm{pitcher})
\tag{4}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t2\)</span> are types of splines. We setup the population level information of the model matrix using <code>mgcv::jagam</code>, and provided it, along with batter and pitcher ids, to the Stan model.</p>

<h2>Variables informing probability of contacting the ball (the outcome submodel)</h2>
<p>Estimating probability of contacting the ball, as with estimating probability of swinging, depend on ball location and directional aceleration. But game context should not matter. We omit game state variables in the outcome submodel, but build a second matrix for the model.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-joint-model" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial joint model</h2>
<p>Next, we combine the identified submodels into a single Stan model of the form described above as a sample selection model. The resulting model, surprisingly, estimated that the mean of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> — the correlation between decisions to swing and whether contact was made — was nearly zero (0.05). This suggests that — at least as parameterized using a computationally tractable amount of data — self selection did not prominently affect probabilities of ball contact. We find this odd, and will continue to explore joint models in a future post.</p>
