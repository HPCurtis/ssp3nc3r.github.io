      <description>Modeling batters’ choices to swing and abilities to contact the ball Variables informing the probability of swinging (the selection submodel) Variables informing probability of contacting the ball (the outcome submodel) Initial joint model References Modeling batters’ choices to swing and abilities to contact the ball Models for decisions to swing and ball contact are more nuanced than a model for called pitches (see Modeling Umpire Calls). Batters’ abilities to contact the ball at a given pitch location are presumably not independent of their decisions to swing.</description>
