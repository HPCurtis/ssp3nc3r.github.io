      <description>ssSankeyGrad returns a ggplot object encoding the flow between beginning and ending categorical data, i.e., a sankey diagram, wherein each flow is encoded as a color gradient. Those color gradients transition between a user-specified color for each category. The parameters are constructed such that c1, c2, col1, col2, and values are all vectors of the same length and corresponding positions represent one flow between categories. The categories c1, c2 are vectors of type character string, col1, col2 are vectors of type character string and include either named colors or hexidecimal representations of color, and values are of an integer or numeric type that encode the amount of “flow” between each category.</description>

      <description>HSLuv is a human-friendly way to describe hue, saturation, and luminance — three attributes of color. The R package includes functions to convert HSLuv colorspace to computer RGB, either as separate red, green, and blue values or as a hex code.
To install, you will need a working toolchain on your computer for compiling C++ code, and the R package devtools installed. Once those are working, simply run the following code in an R session:</description>
