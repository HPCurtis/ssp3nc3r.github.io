      <description>In cycling, (Allen 2019) has been an influential instruction for training and racing with a power meter. The authors discuss training load in the context of a few functions: one they call a training stress score, the other two acute and chronic training load, respectively. Training stress score is an estimate of the amount of work going into a single workout while acute and chronic training loads are estimates of the short and medium term accumulated loads from training.</description>

      <description>Background The Challenge How can we identify causes, relationships One approach for this analysis Identified data of measurements CitiBike ride data Alternative transportation data Weather information Traffic information  Beginning data exploration — daily bike usage   Background In 2013, the NYC Department of Transportation sought to start a bike share to reduce emissions, road wear, congestion, and improve public health.
After selecting an operator and sponsor, the Citi Bike bike share was established with a bike fleet distributed over a network of docking stations throughout the city.</description>

      <description>From logistic regression to a neural net Fitting a logistic regression in R Basic Neural network Forward propogation Back propogation Training the network Our neural network  Bibliography   From logistic regression to a neural net With all the terminology and perhaps unfamiliar looking plots designed to resemble the inner workings of a brain, neural networks may seem confusing. So let’s bypass all the jargon and such for a few minutes.</description>

      <description>Analysis Load and combine data Summarise and prepare data Getting running speed from timestamped coordinates Define variables Graphical overview of coordinates and running speeds Scenario 1: times to first when attempting a double Scenario 2: batters trying to beat a throw to first  Conclusions and Next Steps   In these analyzed data, described below, Trout demonstrated slightly higher expected footspeed and slightly shorter expected times to first base than did Altuve; although their performance is close and we expect a near toss up, given the data used, as to who comes out ahead on any given play.</description>
