      <description>Prefontaine “finally got it through my head that the real purpose of running isn’t to win a race. It’s to test the limits of the human heart. And that he did. Nobody did it more often. Nobody did it better.”
— Bill Bowerman.
We’ve been recording progress towards those limits, whatever they are, for some time. World records have been collected for running distances, from 50 meters on an indoor track to marathons and beyond.</description>

      <description>Let’s practice expressing a probabilistic model aided by physics. Physics have been used, of course, to mathematically describe the forces involved in running short distances. To estimate sprint speed we can inform our models with basic anatomical information and physics. The mathematical physics of running speed depend on body weight, and stride length and rate. Let’s begin with those.
Let’s start with physics equations to describe speed, and accelerating to maximum speed.</description>
